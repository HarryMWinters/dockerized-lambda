# Harry's from Scratch Lambda Repo

This lambda repo should:

1. Provide a good local development experience. This includes running locally
   but also things like integrating with IDEs and using modern python tooling.

1. As much as possible keep local environment and production environment in
   sync. This means docker instead of zip files.

1. Utilize SDLC best practices like linting, type analysis, and testing.

1. Take full advantage of modern CICD like codebuild or github actions.

1. Use social tools like codeowners and PR templates.
